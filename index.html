              Richard D. Grimes, better known as Rick, is a survivor of the
              outbreak in AMC's Television Universe. He is the protagonist in
              The Walking Dead, one of two protagonists in The Walking Dead: The
              Ones Who Live, and a minor character in Fear the Walking Dead.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              Rick is a former sheriff's deputy who was shot in the line of duty
              and fell into a coma, only to awaken and find himself in the midst
              of the apocalypse. He travels to Atlanta, Georgia, in search of
              his wife, Lori, and his son, Carl, who have traveled to Atlanta
              with his best friend, Shane Walsh.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              After reuniting with his family, along with discovering a group of
              survivors, Rick gradually becomes the de-facto leader in their
              search of a safe haven. He eventually enters a relationship with
              Michonne Hawthorne and they later conceive a child together. He
              later becomes the leader of the Alexandria Safe Zone and one of
              the four co-leaders of the Militia along with Maggie Rhee, Ezekiel
              Sutton, and Cyndie before its disbanding.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              A year and a half after the war against the Saviors, Rick adopts a
              peaceful and democratic way of leadership and tries to accomplish
              Carl's dream of rebuilding civilization. He sacrifices himself by
              blowing up a bridge to keep a herd of walkers from overrunning the
              Hilltop. Presumed dead by his loved ones, Rick was rescued by
              former ally Anne and was taken away by the Civic Republic Military
              on a helicopter to a hidden civilization known as the Civic
              Republic, located in what was formerly the city of Philadelphia.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              After being conscripted as a consignee, over the years Rick tried
              numerous times to escape and return home to his family. Despite
              being recaptured each time, he managed to smuggle clues onto a
              boat where it was later found by Michonne. Rick eventually agreed
              to join the CRM through the means of his ally Lieutenant Colonel
              Donald Okafor's plans to reform the CRM for good from the inside
              alongside strong and trusted individuals like Rick. Initially,
              Rick's plan was to use his position as a way to escape, however,
              while never letting go of his love Rick lost his way after years
              of being gone. As time went on, working his way up through the
              ranks and becoming a Sergeant Major, a surprise and unexpected
              reunion with Michonne changed everything for him. After being
              briefed by Major General Beale about a division in the upper ranks
              of the Republic's military who were actively committing atrocities
              for continental superiority, Rick alongside Michonne, fought and
              successfully exposed the genocidal acts to the rest of the Civic
              Republic. In the end, Rick was finally able to return home,
              reunite with his daughter Judith, and meet his son, R.J.

              Lori Grimes (n√©e unknown) is the former tritagonist and a survivor
              of the outbreak in AMC's The Walking Dead. A housewife in King
              County, she was married to Sheriff's Deputy Rick Grimes and had a
              son together named Carl. Lori evacuated to Atlanta with Carl and
              Rick's best friend, Shane Walsh. Meanwhile, Rick was in a coma
              after being shot in the line of duty before the outbreak. While
              evacuating to Atlanta, Shane was unable to get Rick out of the
              hospital and claimed to Lori that Rick had died. After Atlanta was
              napalmed, Shane formed a survivor camp outside the city. Shortly
              after, Lori began a romantic and sexual relationship with Shane.
              Two months after the outbreak, Rick woke up from his coma and
              found Lori and Carl.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              Lori struggled maintaining the peace of the group and her marriage
              to Rick as she ended her relationship with Shane. She later
              discovered that she became pregnant from the affair. This, along
              with their differing opinions on how to lead the group, caused
              tension between Rick and Shane. Upon Lori's request, Rick killed
              Shane and took control of the group. Towards the end of her
              pregnancy, the group settled at a prison. The facility was overrun
              by zombies when Lori went into labor. Unable to deliver the baby,
              Lori sacrificed herself by having Maggie Greene perform a
              caesarean section. While Lori died from the procedure, Maggie was
              able to deliver and save her daughter, Judith.

              Daryl Dixon is a survivor of the outbreak in AMC's Television
              Universe. He is a main character in The Walking Dead and one of
              two protagonists in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. He served as
              the sole protagonist of Daryl Dixon in Season 1 and will serve as
              the co-protagonist, alongside Carol Peletier, starting in Season
              2.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              He is the younger brother of Merle and the last surviving member
              of his family. Daryl is an expert at hunting, tracking,
              navigation, and observation. He is also a skilled combatant,
              knife-wielder and crossbowman. Rick Grimes values him as his
              right-hand man, close friend, and later on as a brother figure.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              Daryl is at first a brazen, surly, impulsive redneck but develops
              himself as an integral part of the group due to his survival
              skills. His aggression is unprecedented, and it remains one of his
              most valuable assets, as well as one of his most noticeable.
              Following the deaths of Ed and Sophia Peletier, Daryl has
              developed a close bond with fellow survivor Carol Peletier. He
              later formed a brief yet close bond with another fellow survivor
              Beth Greene before her demise.

              Following the end of the war against Negan and the Saviors, Daryl
              becomes the new leader of the Saviors, though he eventually
              resigns from the role, giving it to Carol instead. In the years
              following Rick's assumed death, he started living in the woods
              after spending a long time searching for his best friend's body.
              He also came across a dog as well as his former owner, a woman
              named Leah who he develops a romantic bond with, during this time.
              Later on, he forms a parental bond with Lydia and acts as her
              father figure, protecting and caring for her. After moving to the
              Commonwealth, Daryl joined its army alongside Rosita Espinosa. A
              year after Pamela Milton is overthrown, Daryl tells Carol he loves
              her before departing to see what else is out there. He tells
              Judith that if he hears anything about her parents he will find
              them and bring them home. He promises he'll be back before he
              rides off on his bike and starts a new journey somewhere else.

              recruiters for the Alexandria Safe Zone, who bring him to the town

              Despite his best efforts, the cult headed by Teddy succeeds in
              launching ten nuclear warheads, fracturing Morgan's group once

                his brother's whereabouts, Daryl attacks Rick and Shane, who
                subdue him. Daryl vows to retrieve his older brother, horrified
                at the idea that they left Merle bound and unable to fend for
                himself. Rick volunteers to go with him, as do Glenn and T-Dog.

                "You're putting every single one of us at risk," Shane says,
                arguing they need everybody to protect the camp. Rick contends
                that they really need the guns that he dropped when the geeks
                attacked. Lori is against it, but Rick tells her he has to get
                the walkie-talkie back. Otherwise Morgan and Duane could walk
                into the same trap he did.

                After Rick departs, Lori tells Shane to keep away from her
                family. "You are the one that told me that he died," Lori
                seethes. Nearby, an altercation breaks out between Ed Peletier
                and his meek wife, Carol. After Ed slaps Carol, Shane intervenes
                and beats the man mercilessly.

                In Atlanta, Rick and company head to the department store where
                Merle was left. Reaching the door they had barricaded, they see
                the chains have been broken. They then find the rooftop
                deserted, save for a severed hand lying, bloodied, beside a
                hacksaw. Daryl screams, as the screen cuts to black.

                The Atlanta crew follows Merle's trail of blood down to the
                streets. They decide to retrieve Rick's guns before continuing
                the search. Glenn goes for the guns while the others stand
                guard. Their plan is derailed when Daryl is jumped by two men.
                Glenn is then taken hostage, and brought to an inner city
                fortress. Although his captors at first seem hostile, it turns
                out to that they are simply locals who are trying to protect
                elderly survivors in a nursing home. Glenn is set free, and Rick
                passes on some guns to the nursing home staff. Rick, Glenn,
                T-Dog, and Daryl then discover their vehicle is missing.
                "Merle," Rick says. "He's going to be taking some vengeance back

                Back at camp, Andrea and Amy present fellow survivors with fish
                caught in a nearby lake. Dale interrupts the excitement to
                express concern over Jim, who is feverishly digging holes
                without explanation. Shane subdues Jim, who cannot remember
                exactly why he was digging: "I had a reason, don't remember," he
                says. "Something I dreamt last night."

                Andrea, meanwhile, roots through Dale's RV. She's looking for
                something to wrap up Amy's birthday present: a mermaid necklace
                she took from the department store. Later, the group feasts on
                fish around the campfire and the mood takes on a lighter note.
                When Amy steps away to go to the bathroom in the RV, she is
                bitten on the arm by an unseen roamer‚Äîone of many about to
                attack the camp. Rick and his cohorts arrive and drive the
                Walkers back. They are too late, though, to save Amy or Ed. Jim
                has also been bitten during the attack.

                The survivors burn the Walkers, though Glenn insists they should
                bury their dead. Andrea cradles Amy nearby, unwilling to let
                anyone near the body. Dale commiserates, explaining that since

                anything for." Andrea tells Dale she feels guilty for missing so
                many of Amy's birthdays. "I'm sorry for not ever being there,"
                Andrea weeps, kneeling next to a now re-animated Amy. She tells

                When Jim's injury is revealed, and the sickness associated with
                infection worsens, Rick suggests the group go to the CDC for
                help. Shane thinks the Army base in Fort Benning is safer, but
                it is 125 miles away. While sweeping the forest for any
                remaining roamers, Shane tries to convince Rick to change his
                mind. "I've gotta do what's best for my family," Rick says. "If
                it was your family you'd feel differently." Enraged, Shane aims
                his gun at an unknowing Rick, but doesn't pull the trigger. Rick
                didn't see Shane's actions after their argument, but Dale had
                been watching the entire spectacle. "Jesus," he mutters.

                Later, Shane announces his support of Rick's plan. Morales says
                that his family will not be joining the group, and they head off
                in a different direction. En route to the CDC, the RV breaks
                down. Jim, in agony, asks Rick to leave him behind. "I want to
                be with my family," he says of his late wife and children. The
